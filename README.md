### Analysis of Hospital Readmissions in Diabetes Patients
Code: [Analysis of Readmitted Patients (Group GitHub page)](https://github.com/DiabetesGroup/Project)

Description:The objective of this project to find an algorithm which predicts readmission of diabetic patients. Predicting the readmission of diabetic patients will help reduce hospital costs and improve the quality of health care.
We built a predictive model in order to identify diabetic patients who have higher likelihood of being readmitted to the hospital
Based on the analysis of 2 machine learning algorithms: SDG Classification and Random Forest and ROC curve (accuracy scores).
Model can be used to identify future diabetes patients who may be at risk of readmittance to the hospital.
