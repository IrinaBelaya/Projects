## Projects

### Analysis of Hospital Readmissions in Diabetes Patients
Code: [Analysis of Readmitted Patients (Group GitHub page)](https://github.com/DiabetesGroup/Project)

Description: The objective of this project to find an algorithm which predicts readmission of diabetic patients. Predicting the readmission of diabetic patients will help reduce hospital costs and improve the quality of health care.
We built a predictive model in order to identify diabetic patients who have higher likelihood of being readmitted to the hospital
Based on the analysis of 2 machine learning algorithms: SDG Classification and Random Forest and ROC curve (accuracy scores).
Model can be used to identify future diabetes patients who may be at risk of readmittance to the hospital.


### Life Expectancy (World Health Organization)
Code: [Life Expectancy](https://github.com/IrinaBelaya/Life-Expectancy-World-Health-Organization)

Description: Life expectancy is simply defined as the number of years an individual can expect to live. Using the Life Expectancy dataset obtained from the World Health Organization (WHO) database, I performed a linear regression, a multiple linear regression followed by the logistic regression to formulate a hypothesis. After cleaning the dataset, the linear regression revealed that all independent variables impact the dependent variable or life expectancy (Adj. Rsquared = 0.814 and p=0.00). 

### Data Management of Opioid toxicity-related deaths and hospitalizations
Code: [Opioid toxicity-related deaths and hospitalizations](https://github.com/IrinaBelaya/Opioid-toxicity-related-deaths-and-hospitalizations)

Description: Three machine learning models used in the project to predict the outcome of opioid or stimulant toxicity are Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest.
Based on the accuracy score results of each model, my suggestion is to use the Random Forest model for further analysis of opioid/stimulant toxicity.
